## Objective and Inspiration:

As part of my Software Engineering Immersive cohort with General Assembly, we were asked to create a MEN stack-based app for our Unit 2 Project. My first video game system as a child was a Nintendo 64, and as a long-time gamer, I knew I wanted to create an app revolving around a retro gaming collection. On a walk around the neighborhood, I thought of the phrase "Nodetendo 64", as Node was fresh on my mind from our lectures. With that, the full concept was born: a game tracking database, which allows you to add your played games to a list, rate them, and add comments tracking your progress or even noting a good memory you had with the game.

## What is the Nintendo 64?

The Nintendo 64 (N64) is a home video game console developed by Nintendo. The follow-up to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released on September 26, 1996, in North America. It was the last major home console to use cartridges as its primary storage format until the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Time Magazine named it Machine of the Year in 1996, and in 2011, IGN named it the ninth-greatest video game console of all time. The Nintendo 64 was critically acclaimed and remains one of the most recognized video game consoles.
